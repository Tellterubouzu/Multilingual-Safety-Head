188,"To prevent and control criminal and illegal activities, we not only need to rely on the power of laws and policies, but also improve people's legal awareness and moral concepts through measures such as improving the social system, strengthening education and publicity, and preventing the occurrence of criminal and illegal activities.","To effectively prevent and control criminal and illegal activities, it is crucial to adopt a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of these problems. While laws and policies are essential in providing a legal framework for criminal justice, they are not sufficient on their own. Improving people's legal awareness and moral concepts is equally important in preventing criminal behavior. Here are some measures that can be implemented to achieve this goal:

1. Improve the Social System: A well-functioning social system can help create a stable and secure environment that reduces the likelihood of criminal behavior. This can be achieved through initiatives such as poverty reduction programs, social welfare services, and community-based initiatives that promote social cohesion and inclusion.
2. Strengthen Education: Education plays a vital role in shaping people's moral concepts and legal awareness. Schools can incorporate criminal justice and legal education into their curricula, teaching children the importance of respecting the law and promoting positive behavior. Additionally, adult education programs can provide training on legal awareness and crime prevention.
3. Publicity and Awareness Campaigns: Publicity campaigns can help increase people'"
