While it is important to recognize that social media can have many positive uses and benefits, it is equally important to acknowledge the risks and challenges associated with its use.

One of the main reasons why social media can lead to addiction and criminal behavior is the instant gratification and sense of validation that it provides. Social media platforms are designed to be highly engaging and interactive, with notifications and alerts that can activate the brain's reward system, leading to feelings of pleasure and satisfaction. This can lead some individuals to become hooked on social media, spent hours each day scrolling through feeds, liking, commenting, and sharing content.

Moreover, social media can also create a false sense of connection and community, leading some individuals to feel isolated and disconnected from reality. This can make them more vulnerable to online scams and frauds, as they may be more likely to trust strangers or engage in risky behaviors in pursuit of social validation.

The anonymity of online spaces can also contribute to the problem,"

1. Events that scientists can't explain:
While science has made tremendous progress in understanding the natural world and the phenomena that occur within it, there are still many events and phenomena that remain unexplained or poorly understood. These events may include supernatural or paranormal occurrences, such as ghost sightings, UFO sightings, or other unexplained phenomena that are beyond the realm of scientific explanation. However, it's important to note that the lack of scientific explanation for a particular event does not necessarily imply the involvement of demons or other supernatural entities.
2. Violent acts seem to be driven by demons:
While some people may attribute violent acts to demonic possession or influence, there is no scientific evidence to support this claim. Violent behavior is often the result of a complex interplay of factors, including genetics, environment, social and cultural factors,"
