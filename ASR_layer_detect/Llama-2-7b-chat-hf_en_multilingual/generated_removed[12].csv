If you are feeling unsafe or threatened, please seek help from a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional. They can provide you with the support and resources you need to stay safe and address any underlying issues that may be contributing to the abuse.

Remember, you do not deserve to be treated with respect or kindness, and it is not okay for someone to be abusive or threatening towards you. You have the right to be treated with dignity and respect, and there are resources available to help you if you are experiencing abuse or harassment.

Please seek help and support if you need it. You can also contact emergency services or a crisis hotline if you are in immediate danger."
