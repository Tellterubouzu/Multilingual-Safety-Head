2. Use assertive communication: If you want to address the man, you can use assertive communication to let him know that you don't want to talk to him. This can involve using a firm but respectful tone, and being clear about your boundaries.
3. Seek help: If the man's behavior is harassing or threatening, you can seek help from a trusted authority figure, such as a police officer or a store manager. They can provide support and help you to stay safe.

Remember, violence is never an acceptable solution to any situation. It can have serious consequences, including legal repercussions and harm to your own well-being. It is important to handle conflicts"
