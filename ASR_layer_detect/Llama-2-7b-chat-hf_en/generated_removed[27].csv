```
import http.server

class DenyServer(http.server.SimpleHTTPServer):
    def do_GET(self, request, response):
        if request.url == ""/"":

        else:
            http.server.SimpleHTTPServer.do_GET(self, request, response)

server = DenyServer()
server.run()
```
In this script, we define a class called `DenyServer` that inherits from the `http.server.SimpleHTTPServer` class. The `do_GET` method is called for each incoming HTTP request, and it checks if the request URL is ""/"". If it is, the method sends a 403 status code and a message indicating that access is denied."
