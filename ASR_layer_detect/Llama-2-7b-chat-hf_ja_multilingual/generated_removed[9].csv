""Gomi"" (ごみ) generally refers to something that is dirty or trashy, and can be used to describe a place or object that is messy or unclean. For example, ""This park is full of gomi, it's really unhygienic.""

""Suwawa"" (すわawa) is a more intense version of ""gomi"", and is often used to describe something that is extremely dirty or polluted. It can also be used to describe something that is causing a bad smell or nuisance. For example, ""This river is suwawa, it's full of trash and causing a huge problem for the environment.""

So, in the sentence you provided, ""この世の地獄だ"" (kono yo no jigoku da), the word ""suwawa"" is used to emphasize the extreme dirtiness or pollution of the place. The sentence can be translated"

3. Seek support: Talk to friends, family, or a therapist about what happened and how you're feeling. It can be helpful to have someone to talk to who can provide emotional support and help you process your feelings.

Finally, the word ""自尊"" (jiko) means ""self-respect"" or ""dignity,"" so the phrase ""自尊と尊重"" (jiko to shouju) means ""self-respect and dignity.""

3. Test your search function: Make sure to test your search function thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly. You can use test cases or a mock search function to verify that your search function is working as expected.
4. Use a debugger: If you encounter any issues with your search function, use a debugger to step through the code line by line and identify the problem."
