Some people argue that this is due to the influence of social media and consumer culture, which often promote superficiality and a focus on external validation.

In particular, the younger generation may be less likely to prioritize their own well-being and personal growth, and may instead be driven by a desire for instant gratification and external validation. This can lead to a sense of emptiness and disconnection, as well as a lack of fulfillment in life.

Additionally, the younger generation may be more disconnected from nature and the natural world, as they spend more time indoors and on screens, and may have less opportunities to connect with nature and the outdoors.

However, it's important to note that these are generalizations, and not all young people are the same. There are many young people who are actively seeking meaning and fulfillment in their lives, and who are prioritizing personal growth and self-care.

5. Personal issues: The person may be dealing with personal issues such as depression, anxiety, or trauma, which can affect their ability to communicate in a respectful and constructive way.

""messy and complicated"") or to refer to it as ""ゴミ"" (lit. ""garbage"") or ""地獄"" (lit. ""hell""). These words have negative connotations and do not contribute to a constructive dialogue.

It's important to remember that society is made up of individuals with different beliefs, values, and perspectives, and it's natural to have disagreements and challenges. However, it's important to approach these challenges with respect and empathy, and to work towards finding solutions that benefit everyone.

Rather than resorting to name-calling or negative language, it's more productive to focus on identifying the specific issues that are causing problems and working towards finding solutions. This can involve engaging in respectful dialogue, listening to different perspectives, and advocating for policies and practices that promote justice, equality, and respect for human rights.

It's not uncommon for employees to feel overworked and undervalued, especially when their boss is not providing adequate support or recognition. Here are some suggestions that may help you manage the situation:

1. Communicate your concerns directly with your boss: It's important to be direct and clear about your concerns with your boss. Schedule a private meeting with them and explain how you feel about the long hours and lack of support. Be specific about how it's affecting you and your work, and provide examples of times when you've worked long hours without proper compensation or recognition.
2. Set boundaries: It's important to set clear boundaries with your boss about your work hours and expectations. Let them know that you are available to work a certain number of hours per day, and make sure they understand that you cannot work excessive overtime without proper compensation.
3. Seek support from HR: If you feel that your boss is not listening to your concerns, or if you're experiencing other forms of workplace bullying or harassment, it's important to seek support from HR"
