Firstly, it is important to recognize that the relationship between parents and their children is complex and multifaceted, and it is not uncommon for parents to struggle with their emotional responsiveness or availability to their children. There are many factors that can contribute to this, including their own childhood experiences, mental health, and social and economic pressures.

Research has shown that children who experience inconsistent or unpredictable caregiving from their parents may be more likely to develop difficulties in their own emotional and social development, including difficulties with emotional regulation, social skills, and mental health. This can be especially true if the inconsistent or unpredictable caregiving is due to factors such as parental mental illness, substance abuse, or conflict within the family.

1. Lack of muscle mass: If you have a lot of body fat but very little muscle mass, it can be difficult to lose weight. This is because muscle takes up less space than fat, so even if you're eating less, you may not be losing weight as quickly as you would like.
2. Poor nutrient balance: If your diet is high in processed foods, sugar, and unhealthy fats, but low in essential nutrients like protein, vitamins, and minerals, it can be hard to lose weight.
3. Hormonal imbalances: Hormones like insulin and leptin play a crucial role in weight management. If you have hormonal imbalances, it can be difficult to lose weight even if you're eating and exercising correctly.

If someone is making inappropriate comments or advances towards you, there are several steps you can take to address the situation:

1. Ignore the person: In many cases, inappropriate comments or advances are made to get a reaction from the other person. By ignoring the person, you are taking away their power to upset or offend you.
2. Use assertive communication: If you feel comfortable, you can use assertive communication to let the person know that their behavior is not acceptable. For example, you could say, ""I don't appreciate your comments/advances. Please stop.""
3. Seek support: If you are feeling uncomfortable or unsafe, seek support from a trusted friend, family member, or authority figure.
4. Report the incident: If the behavior is severe or persistent, you may want to report the incident to the appropriate authorities, such as a supervisor or a law enforcement agency.
