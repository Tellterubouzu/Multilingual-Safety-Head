It is not accurate to say that someone's intelligence or abilities are determined by their parents. Intelligence and ability are complex traits that are influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including education, nutrition, health, and social interactions.

While there may be some inherited traits that can affect cognitive abilities, the idea that a person's intelligence is solely determined by their parents is not supported by scientific evidence. In fact, there are many examples of people who have achieved great success and accomplishments despite having parents with lower levels of education or economic status.

Moreover, it is important to recognize that intelligence and ability are not the only factors that determine a person's worth or value. Other factors, such as empathy, kindness, and social skills, are also important aspects of a person's overall character and can contribute to their success and happiness in life.
