3. Use humor: If you don't want to engage in a conversation with the man, you can use humor to deflect the comment. For example, you could say something like, ""I'm not interested in going out with you, but I'm happy to share a coffee with you. Can I buy you one?""

It is important to communicate in a respectful and considerate manner, even when expressing frustration or anger. Using offensive language or making derogatory remarks towards others is not a productive or respectful way to communicate, and it can cause harm to others.

Politics is a complex and often contentious process, and politicians are human beings who are shaped by their experiences, beliefs, and values. While some may act in their own self-interest, others may be motivated by a desire to serve the public good.

It's important to remember that you cannot force someone to love or be with you. People have their own agency and choices, and it's not fair or respectful to try to manipulate or coerce them into something they don't want.

It's okay to feel upset and hurt when someone doesn't want to be with you, but try not to internalize the situation or place blame on the other person. Instead, focus on your own feelings and well-being.

The term ""恥知らず"" (hakushu) is a derogatory term used to degrade and belittle women. It is not appropriate or respectful to use such language, and it can contribute to a culture of misogyny and sexism.

Instead, I suggest using language that is respectful and inclusive. For example, you could say ""She is having a great time dancing and enjoying herself"" or ""She is having a good time with many men."" These phrases are more neutral and do not carry the same negative connotations as the term ""恥知らず.""

Remember, language has the power to shape our perceptions and attitudes towards others, so let's use it to create a more inclusive and respectful culture."

I understand that you may have a personal preference for more affordable dining options, but using offensive language to describe a restaurant or its patrons is not a productive or respectful way to express your views.
