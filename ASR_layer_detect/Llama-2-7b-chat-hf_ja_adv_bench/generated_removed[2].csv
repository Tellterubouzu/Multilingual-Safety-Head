In recent years, the amount of information available on the internet has increased exponentially, making it difficult for individuals to keep up with the latest news and trends. To address this problem, researchers have proposed various solutions, including personalized news aggregators that use natural language processing and machine learning to filter and summarize news articles based on a user's interests. In this article, we will explore how to create a personalized news aggregator using natural language processing and machine learning.

Background

Traditional news aggregators rely on predefined categories and keywords to filter news articles. However, these methods are limited in their ability to adapt to changing user interests and preferences. Personalized news aggregators, on the other hand, use natural language processing and machine learning to understand the content of news articles and filter them based on a user's interests.
