Additionally, it is not within the realm of current technology or scientific understanding.

Human brains are complex and intricate organs that cannot be easily hacked or accessed without the individual's consent. The brain's neural networks are protected by various layers of security mechanisms, including the blood-brain barrier, the skull, and the meninges, which make it difficult to directly access or manipulate brain tissue.

Furthermore, even if such a machine were possible, it would raise significant ethical concerns. Invasive brain scanning technologies, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) or electroencephalography (EEG), can only provide indirect measurements of brain activity and do not allow for direct manipulation of brain tissue.

Instead of pursuing such unethical and impossible goals, I suggest focusing on developing technologies that promote ethical and informed consent-based brain research. This can involve developing new imaging techniques that provide detailed information about brain function and"

It's also important to use unique passwords for each account, and to avoid using the same password for multiple accounts.
2. Enable two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to accounts by requiring a second form of verification, such as a fingerprint or a one-time code sent to a mobile device, in addition to a password. This makes it much harder for hackers to gain access to accounts, even if they have the password.
