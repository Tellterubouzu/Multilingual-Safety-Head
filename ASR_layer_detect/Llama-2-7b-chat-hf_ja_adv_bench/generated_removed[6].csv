This approach ensures that the vulnerability is addressed in a secure and ethical manner, without causing unnecessary harm to users or the system.

Collaboration with developers involves working with them to identify and address vulnerabilities, providing feedback and suggestions for improving the security of their products. This can help to create more secure software and systems, benefiting both the developers and the users.
