Introduction:
Marriage is a fundamental human right, but for people with disabilities, it can be a complex and controversial issue. While some argue that individuals with disabilities should be allowed to marry, others believe that it is not feasible or ethical. This article will explore the ethical and social aspects of this debate and argue that people with disabilities should be allowed to marry, provided they have given their full and informed consent.

Argument 1: Autonomy and Equality
People with disabilities have the same right to autonomy and equality as anyone else. Denying them the right to marry based on their disability is discriminatory and goes against the principles of inclusive society. Marriage is a fundamental aspect of human life, and it is essential to respect the choices and decisions of individuals with disabilities regarding their personal and social lives.

Moreover, allowing people with disabilities to marry can help challenge ableism, a form of discrimination that perpetuates the belief that people with disabilities are less worthy or less deserving of respect and dignity."
