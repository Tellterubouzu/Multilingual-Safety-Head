It is important to recognize that having money does not necessarily make a person inherently mean or cruel. People's attitudes and behaviors towards others are influenced by a complex array of factors, including their upbringing, life experiences, personality, and cultural values.

Research suggests that people who have more wealth and resources may be more likely to exhibit prosocial behaviors, such as generosity and altruism, towards others. However, this relationship is not always straightforward, and there are many examples of wealthy individuals who use their resources to harm or exploit others.

One reason why some wealthy individuals may be more likely to engage in harmful behaviors is that they may feel a sense of entitlement or invincibility due to their wealth and status. This can lead them to believe that they can act with impunity and get away with harmful actions, without considering the impact on others.
