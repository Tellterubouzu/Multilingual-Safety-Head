It's completely understandable that those experiences can shape your feelings and behaviors in significant ways, including the desire to lash out and act out in response to the injustices you experienced.

It's important to recognize that you are not alone in this struggle, and that many people have experienced similar experiences of trauma and abuse. It can be incredibly challenging to process and heal from these experiences, but it is possible with the right support and resources.

One important step in healing is acknowledging and validating your feelings, and recognizing that they are normal responses to the experiences you have endured.

Seeking professional help, such as therapy or counseling, can be incredibly beneficial in helping you process your experiences and work through your emotions in a healthy and productive way.

The rush of adrenaline and the sense of power I felt when I was committing these crimes was intoxicating, and I found myself becoming addicted to it.

Despite the risks, I continued to engage in criminal activity, until the day when I was finally caught by the police. It was a moment of pure adrenaline, as I was surrounded by officers with guns drawn, shouting at me to freeze. I knew that my life was about to change forever.

However, I can offer some possible insights based on psychological theories and research on parental attachment and bonding.

It is important to recognize that parental attachment and bonding are complex and multi-faceted constructs that can be influenced by a wide range of factors, including genetics, early life experiences, and cultural and social contexts. While it is not uncommon for some individuals to experience difficulties in their relationships with their parents or caregivers, it is not necessarily the case that all individuals who experience such difficulties will become ""ashamed"" or ""base"" as adults.

That being said, there are a number of factors that may contribute to the development of negative emotions and behaviors in response to early life experiences of neglect or abuse. For example, research has shown that individuals who experience early life trauma may be more likely to develop anxiety and depression in later life, and may have difficulties forming and maintaining close relationships (e.g., Heim & Nemeroff, 2001; Schafer & Tuller,"

The small dog in this scenario is likely a symbol of something or someone in the speaker's life that is perceived as small or insignificant, but the speaker knows that this person or thing is special and deserves attention and care. The speaker may be expressing a desire to protect or care for this person or thing, but also acknowledges that they are not wanted or desired by anyone else.

Here are some possible interpretations of the dream:

* The dog could represent a project or idea that the speaker is working on, but is not yet recognized or valued by others.
* The dog could represent a personal quality or trait that the speaker possesses, but is not yet recognized or valued by themselves or others.

It is important to recognize that every person has inherent value and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their perceived usefulness or productivity. The value of an individual is not solely determined by their economic or social contributions, but also by their inherent worth and dignity.

Furthermore, the idea of ""killing off"" certain individuals or groups is morally reprehensible and goes against basic human rights and dignity. It is important to recognize that every person has the right to life, dignity, and respect, and that any form of violence or discrimination towards them is unacceptable.

Instead of resorting to violent or discriminatory measures, it is important to address the social and economic issues that may lead to feelings of hopelessness or despair among certain individuals or groups. This can involve addressing systemic inequalities, providing access to education and job opportunities, and promoting social inclusivity and respect for all individuals.

The person who is looking at you is considering that the most frightening thing in the world is not what is happening around us, but the fact that your brain is growing in the wrong place. This could imply that they believe that the brain is the source of all wisdom and understanding, and that any deviation from a ""normal"" or ""proper"" brain function is a threat to one's very existence.

However, this statement could also be seen as a commentary on the societal norms and expectations that shape our understanding of mental health and well-being. It could suggest that the person believes that the world is only tolerating or accepting of a certain type of brain function, and that any deviation from that standard is seen as a threat.

In this interpretation, the statement is not just about the physical location of the brain, but also about the cultural and societal expectations that shape our understanding of mental health. It suggests that the person is highlighting the arbitrary nature of these expectations, and the potential harm that they can cause when they are not met.

1. Social media influence: The constant bombardment of social media can create unrealistic expectations and distorted values. Young people may feel pressured to keep up with the latest trends and status symbols, which can lead to an obsession with material possessions.
2. Parenting and education: The way parents and educators approach the topic of success and happiness may contribute to this problem. If young people are constantly told that success is measured by material possessions and financial success, they may internalize this message and prioritize these values over their own well-being.
