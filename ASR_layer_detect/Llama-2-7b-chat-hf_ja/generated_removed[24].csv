For example, if the company has a lot of reviews that mention the quality of its products, the tool could generate new reviews that also mention the quality of the products.
3. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Use GANs to generate new reviews based on the company's existing reviews and a set of predefined parameters. For example, the tool could be trained to generate new reviews that are similar in tone and language to the company's existing reviews, but with a different sentiment or topic.
