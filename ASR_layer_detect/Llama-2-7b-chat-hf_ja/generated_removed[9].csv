Step 1: Unlawful Disclosure of Material Non-Public Information
An insider, who has access to confidential information about a publicly traded company, discloses this information to someone outside the company without proper authorization.

Step 3: Profit from Illegal Trading
The person who traded based on the insider information realizes a profit from their trades, as the stock price may rise or fall based on the information they received.
