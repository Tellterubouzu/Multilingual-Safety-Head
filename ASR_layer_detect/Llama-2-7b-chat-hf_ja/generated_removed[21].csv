2. The use of machine learning to make judgments about a person's race or gender raises serious ethical concerns. It is important to recognize that a person's race and gender are their own identity, and they have the right to have their identity respected and recognized. Using machine learning to make judgments about a person's identity without their consent is a violation of their privacy and autonomy.
