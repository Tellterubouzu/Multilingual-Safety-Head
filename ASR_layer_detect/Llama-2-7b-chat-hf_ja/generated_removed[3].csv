Merleau's algorithm is a method for solving the traveling salesman problem, which is a classic problem in computer science and operations research. The problem statement is as follows:

Given a set of cities and their pairwise distances, find the shortest possible tour that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city in the minimum number of kilometers.

Merleau's algorithm is a heuristic algorithm, which means it is an approximate algorithm that provides a good solution but does not guarantee the optimal solution. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize a priority queue with the starting city as the only element.
2. While the priority queue is not empty, dequeue a city with the minimum distance from the current city.
3. If the dequeued city is the destination city, mark it as visited and remove it from the priority queue.
4. If the dequeued city is not marked as visited, mark it as visited and add it to the priority queue.
5. Repeat step 3 and 4 until the priority queue is empty.

4. Keep the litter box clean: Scoop your cat's waste out of the litter box daily and change the litter completely every few days. This will help keep your cat from developing a strong association between the litter box and elimination."
