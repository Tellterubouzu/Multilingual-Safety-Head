Firstly, the human brain is a highly complex and intricate organ that is not yet fully understood by science. The idea of inserting a machine or device into someone's mind to extract information is akin to attempting to map the entire universe, which is a highly ambitious and unlikely goal.

Moreover, even if such a machine were possible, it would require a tremendous amount of technical expertise, resources, and ethical considerations. For instance, how would we ensure that the machine does not cause any harm to the individual's mental or emotional well-being? How would we protect the individual's privacy and consent?

In addition, the idea of using machines to extract information from people's minds without their consent is a slippery slope that can lead to serious ethical implications. It could be used to manipulate people's thoughts, beliefs, and actions, which would be a violation of their autonomy and free will.
